# SleepMedic Editorial Guidelines (Persistent, Science-Forward)

## What good looks like
- Useful first, poetic second. Real help for real people (shift work, medics, travelers, parents, menopause).
- Varied formats and intros by week (see Template Rotation).
- Science-forward: mechanisms + what to do next. Plain language, tight paragraphs (1–3 sentences).

## Template Rotation (deterministic)
Choose one format per post using `isoWeek % 6`:
0. **Story-First** — Lived moment → stakes → mechanism → protocol → reflective close.
1. **Science-First** — Cold open stat or finding → explain mechanism → apply → checklist.
2. **Myth-Busting** — 3–5 myths → evidence for each → what to do instead.
3. **Field Manual** — Problem → quick triage decision-tree (If X, then Y) → protocol → pitfalls.
4. **Q&A** — 5–7 precise questions people actually ask → concise, cited answers → mini-checklist.
5. **History/Philosophy Lens** — short vignette or quote (verifiable) → modern physiology → practice.

## Intros (rotate with the template)
- Story hook (concrete, sensory).
- Data hook (one striking, sourced stat).
- Myth hook (“You’ve heard X. Here’s what the data says.”).
- Command hook (imperative line, then why).
- Question hook (“Why do hot flashes wake you at 3 a.m.?”).
- History hook (one-line vignette, then pivot).

## Science Bar (every post)
- Include **3–6 evidence points** tied to named mechanisms (e.g., circadian phase, homeostatic sleep drive, thermoregulation, autonomic arousal).
- Cite **trusted orgs or primary reviews** (CDC, NIH, NIA, NAMS, AASM, ACOG, WHO, Cochrane). Link inline.
- Use **plain language** explanations after each mechanism: “What this means for you → …”
- No filler quotes. Only verifiable classics (e.g., Marcus Aurelius, Seneca) or none.

## Menopause-Specific Rules (when topic involves menopause)
- Cover **vasomotor symptoms** and **thermoregulation** disrupting sleep; note circadian fragmentation and awakenings.
- Mention evidence-based options at a high level: **CBT-I**, sleep timing/consistency, cooling strategies, light management, exercise timing, alcohol/caffeine limits.
- Briefly note medical avenues to discuss with clinicians (e.g., **MHT/HRT** appropriateness, **non-hormonal** options such as certain SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, clonidine) **without dosing**; state “talk to your clinician.”
- Flag screening considerations: **OSA risk increases midlife**, mood symptoms, and when to seek care.

## Practical Help (non-negotiable)
- Include **one** of these: a **decision tree**, a **one-week protocol** (AM/PM actions), or a **checklist + tracker**.
- Write steps as commands. 3–7 items. Make success measurable (e.g., “Wake at 06:30 ±15 min for 7 days”).
- Add **“If this, then that”** branches for common constraints (nights, 24s/48s, kids, travel).

## Links
- **4–8 inline links** from the whitelist only. Prefer: NAMS, NIH/NIA, AASM, ACOG, CDC, WHO, Cochrane, NICE.

## Formatting
- Title: 6–10 words; allow colons/periods; avoid clickbait.
- Length: ~700–1,000 words.
- 2–4 **Image ideas** that are conceptual (no cheesy stock).
- End with: **Checklist or Protocol**, **Sources**, **Brief disclaimer**.

## Tone
- Direct, human, stoic, practical. No corporate buzzwords. No vague “optimize.”
- Close with a short, grounded line. Example: “Rest well. Rise ready.”
